        <p>
          The Aeropress is a coffee-making contraption that produces strong,
          flavorful coffee with minimal effort. While there is one standard
          method of brewing coffee provided by the manufacturer, many people
          have come up with their own adaptations. This is a simple recipe for
          an amazing cup of coffee with the aeropress, popularized by James
          Hoffmann. It takes about 5 minutes in total.

          <li>Mug</li>
          <li>1 cup boiling hot water</li>

        <ol>
          <li>Boil the water.</li>
          <li>
            While the water is boiling, scoop the coffee into the aeropress
            coffee filter chamber.
          </li>
          <li>
            When water is boiled, add the water to the filter chamber to the
            number 4 circle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Press the plunger slightly into the Aeropress chamber, just enough
            to create a vacuum seal.
          </li>
          <li>Let the coffee brew for about 2 minutes.</li>
          <li>
            Holding the Aeropress plunger and chamber, gently swirl to break up
            the coffee crust. Stop swirling once the coffee frees up and wait 30
            seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slowly plunge with equal pressure. This should take about 30
            seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once fully plunged, pull the plunger back a little to help prevent
            drippage. Then discard the coffee grounds.
          </li>
          <li>Enjoy!</li>
