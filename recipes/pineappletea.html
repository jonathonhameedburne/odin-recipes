        <p>
          This is a simple recipe for a healthy, warming batch of ginger
          pineapple tea. It's a great way to make use of pineapple rinds.
          Serving size is about 4 cups. It takes about 10-30 minutes in total
          depending on how strong you want your tea to be.

        <ol>
          <li>Boil the water in the pot.</li>
          <li>
            While water is boiling, cut the pineapple rinds off of the pineapple
            and cut them into smmall strips, around 3 inches long and an inch
            wide.
          </li>
          <li>Mince the ginger or cut into small strips.</li>
          <li>
            Put the ginger and pineapple rinds in the water. You can put them in
            while the water is boiling or you can wait for the water to boil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once water is fully boiling, turn down heat to maintain a simmer.
            Simmer covered or uncovered for at least 7 minutes, or as long as
            you prefer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strain the tea into a large jar and pour individual servings as
            desired.
          </li>
          <li>Enjoy!</li>
